## 1. Executive Summary <a name="1-executive-summary"></a>

### Market Problem
- Many crypto projects fail post-listing due to early investors dumping tokens, leading to severe price collapses.
- Traditional online casinos spend huge sums (up to $100M) to prove liquidity and payout capability.

### Our Solution
Goldragon & GDT offers a sustainable token model that integrates:
- An AI Hedging Bot (Aionis) generating stable profits and reinvesting those profits to support GDT’s price.
- Knights Table, a blockchainized online casino, where transparency of liquidity replaces expensive marketing spend.

This creates a circular ecosystem that incentivizes long-term holding and real-world adoption.

## 5. AI Hedging Bot (Aionis) Mechanism <a name="5-ai-hedging-bot-aionis-mechanism"></a>

### Functionality
- Aionis generates profits by employing hedging strategies on global platforms.

### Profit Allocation Strategies
- Plan A:
  - 80% of profits are reinvested into GDT
  - 20% are allocated as GDCP (Goldragon Community Points) for use in Knights Table or community events
- Plan B:
  - 60% of profits are withdrawable
  - 20% are reinvested into GDT
  - 20% are allocated as GDCP
  - Post-listing: The 60% is converted to GDT (with no vesting period), while 20% remains locked for one year

### Risk Management
- Aionis stops trading if both platform account balances fall beyond a -5% variance threshold.

## 6. Knights Table – Blockchainized Casino <a name="6-knights-table--blockchainized-casino"></a>

### Overview
- Knights Table is our blockchain-based online casino designed to replace traditional, expensive marketing methods with transparency and efficiency.

### GDT in the Casino
- A stablecoin pegged to SGD will be implemented for day-to-day transactions to mitigate the volatility of GDT.

### Transparency & Trust
- The casino operates on smart contracts ensuring provable fairness.
- On-chain display of liquidity gives players direct insight into the casino’s funds, eliminating the need for large-scale marketing spend to prove solvency.

### Revenue Sharing
- GDT holders receive rewards initially through AI hedging bonuses, with a gradual shift toward sharing casino profits.

### Liquidity Pool (Concept)
- A hybrid model where the casino treasury uses both stablecoin transactions and GDT collateral.
- A portion of casino revenue is allocated to maintaining liquidity for smooth payouts.

## 7. Token Price Stability Mechanism <a name="7-token-price-stability-mechanism"></a>

### Dynamic Supply Adjustment
- Controlled Token Release:
  - If the token price increases beyond a predefined threshold (e.g., +5% in 24 hours or +10% in 48 hours), a limited portion of reserve tokens may be released to enhance liquidity and moderate rapid price increases.
- Strategic Buybacks:
  - If the token price declines beyond a critical level, a portion of the platform’s USDT reserve may be allocated for targeted buybacks. This reduces the circulating supply, increases buying pressure, and supports market stability.

### Liquidity Pool Optimization
- Active Monitoring:
  - The GDT/USDT liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is continuously monitored and adjusted.
  - This ensures sufficient liquidity depth and mitigates extreme price fluctuations from large trades.

### Sustainable Market Growth
- The stabilization mechanism supports organic growth without over-controlling price action.
- As natural demand increases and the ecosystem matures, the need for active intervention will gradually decrease.
